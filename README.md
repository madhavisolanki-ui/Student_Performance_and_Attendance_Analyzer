# Minor Project: [Student Performance and Attendance Analyzer]

##  Problem Statement
This project aims to solve the problem of [Student Performance and Attendance Analyzer].

##  Objective
The main objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can [predict/classify/analyze] based on the given dataset.

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains [Name,Gender,Phone_Number,State of birth,Email,Student_id,Qualification,Course,Semester,GPA,CGPA,etc....].

##  Project Workflow
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Model Training
5. Model Evaluation

##  Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of **[60%]**.

##  Future Improvements
- Improve model performance
- Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit
- Use a larger and more diverse dataset
